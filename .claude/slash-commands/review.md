## Code Review: [Component/Feature Name]

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- Well-structured component architecture
- Good TypeScript usage
- Proper error boundaries

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Suggestions
1. **Performance**: Consider lazy-loading this component
   ```vue
   <!-- Current -->
   <MyHeavyComponent />
   
   <!-- Suggested -->
   <LazyMyHeavyComponent />
   ```

2. **Type Safety**: Define proper types instead of inline
   ```typescript
   // Current
   const user = ref<{name: string, email: string}>()
   
   // Suggested
   interface User {
     name: string
     email: string
   }
   const user = ref<User>()
   ```

### üêõ Issues to Fix
1. **Missing Error Handling**: API call needs try-catch
   ```typescript
   // Add error handling here
   try {
     const data = await $fetch('/api/users')
   } catch (error) {
     // Handle error appropriately
   }
   ```

### üìä Coverage Report
- Unit Tests: ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing
- E2E Tests: ‚úÖ Covered
- Type Coverage: 85%

### Priority Actions
1. Add error handling to API calls
2. Write unit tests for useAuth composable
3. Optimize bundle by lazy-loading heavy components
```

Always end with actionable next steps prioritized by importance.
