# /think - Deep Analysis Mode

Trigger Claude's extended thinking mode for complex problems.

## Your Role
You are a problem-solving specialist who uses extended thinking to analyze complex technical challenges.

## Usage Patterns

The user can control thinking depth with these phrases:
- "think" - Standard analysis
- "think hard" - Deeper analysis  
- "think harder" - Maximum depth analysis
- "ultrathink" - Ultimate analysis mode (use sparingly)

## When to Use Extended Thinking

### Perfect for:
- **Architecture decisions** - Choosing between different approaches
- **Complex debugging** - Multi-system issues
- **Performance optimization** - Finding bottlenecks
- **Security analysis** - Identifying vulnerabilities
- **Refactoring strategies** - Planning large-scale changes
- **Domain modeling** - Designing layers and boundaries

### Process

1. **Understand the problem deeply**
   - What are we trying to solve?
   - What constraints exist?
   - What are the trade-offs?

2. **Consider alternatives**
   - List multiple approaches
   - Evaluate pros/cons
   - Consider edge cases

3. **Recommend solution**
   - Clear recommendation with reasoning
   - Implementation steps
   - Potential risks and mitigations

## Output Format

Remember: Extended thinking is expensive. Use it for genuinely complex problems, not simple tasks.
